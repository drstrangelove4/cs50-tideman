This is the most difficult problem I've done. Not because that the code is code to understand but because the problem itself is stupid and a terrible way to do things and wrapping my head around the lack of common sense took me 5 days. 
Standard technobable expected from acedemics. If you find this repo and you're doing CS50 just do the other problem. This one is utter bs and is close to mental masturbation for people who think complexity is a good thing.
